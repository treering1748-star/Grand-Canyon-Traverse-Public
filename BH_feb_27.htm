    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Fossil Bay at last. I’ve been intrigued with this little corner of the 
    Canyon since I first noticed its unique drainage on the topo; and frankly, I 
    like the name as well. There are Fossils here too. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">It was an interesting walk 
    here from this side of Forster, but of course different from anything I 
    could have imagined. Getting out of the Forster drainage in the morning was 
    time consuming and tedious, one little side canyon after another. But there 
    were rewards. By the time we got even with Enfilade Point we had a gorgeous 
    view up Conquistador Aisle – a nearly straight section of the river for 10 
    miles or so, and a view down the river toward the Thumb, as far as the 
    Middle Granite Gorge. We sat there on a Supai ledge, suspended over this 800 
    to 1000ft. drop and rested.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">After eight miles or so from 
    last camp we were pretty much through the large side canyon work and it was 
    a straight shot into Fossil. A fault forms the canyon and it is called the 
    Fossil-Monument-Eremita Monocline. I like the name. The result of this fault 
    or monocline is that all the Supai strata on this side of fossil canyon 
    tilts down at an appreciable angle toward the bed of Fossil. So from looking 
    at the head of Fossil from about 3-4 miles away you see this long sloping 
    plain with exposed to red rock showing in places, making acres of paved 
    country, and a few low ridges and rounded hills. What you don’t see are 4 
    long, deep, illogical washes that run across the plain into Fossil Canyon. 
    Illogical because they are deeper at the head or start of the washes (or 
    canyons) than at the point where they meet Fossil Canyon. Not only are they 
    illogical, they are difficult to cross.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Just before we started on this 
    last section I was just beginning to climb up a small ridge out of a side 
    canyon when I spotted an arrowhead. It is made of a whitish chert rock, has 
    a broken tip and base. It’s about an inch and a half long now. It’s been a 
    long time since I’ve found an arrowhead. I took it as a good omen.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, coming across the plane 
    to fossil I found a mule shoe! How did it get here? There are no routes that 
    we know of from Forster to Tahuta Point, on the other side of the Thumb, 
    which mules can traverse. Even the wild burros can’t get into this country!&nbsp; 
    It’s a mystery to me.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now Fossil itself. It is a 
    fine canyon. Jim and I walked all the way to just below the Coconino -- as 
    if we didn’t have enough walking today already! There is a seep spring which 
    enters here at the base of the Coconino, and from there we can see our whole 
    route traversed in the past three days from Apache Point. We are camped now 
    at the junction of the main bed of Fossil and the first side side canyon 
    from the east. A couple of hundred yards up the main bed are dozens of 
    potholes. Very pretty ones. The deepest -- the one Butchart describes, I 
    guess -- is almost 3ft. deep.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We’re camped under a little 
    overhang and tilted rock, which someone must have used for a period of time 
    as the back wall of the rock has been filled in with a rock wall to keep the 
    wind out. We won’t have to set the tent up tonight.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">One of the best omens we’d had 
    today has been the rain. About a half hour before we arrived it started to 
    drip and just after we arrived it started coming down steady. We were in 
    time to see the rocks dry, then wet. It rained for about an hour. We feel 
    much better about the water situation on the other side now too.&nbsp; It has 
    been wet all the way from Forster with nearly every canyon having a trickle.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    JRS</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    We made it to Fossil Bay. A very good day. Hard like all the others, but 
    with a definite sense of miles covered. The Thumb is at hand. It was a bit 
    more dissected than I thought it would be, but somewhat better per mile on 
    the average than the terrain up to now. We also had several spectacular 
    river views. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We found the pothole Butchart 
    mentions and indeed it does look reliable; protected by being in the bed of 
    the wash, about 3ft. deep and bathtub size. We also found a large cairn 
    about 100 yds. downstream from it, beneath which was the remains of 
    someone’s supply cache; 4 large plastic containers of trash. Also an empty 
    Coleman can. I was somewhat angered that it hadn’t been removed, but the 
    Coleman can will be a welcome water container, should we need one. I could 
    figure no way this cache could have been placed here except perhaps by 
    helicopter. Someone might have climbed down Butchart’s route, but somehow I 
    think that unlikely.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking of unlikely, Tomas 
    discovered a mule shoe about 1/2 mile from here. How anyone managed to bully 
    a mule down here, where even the burros don’t go, boggles the imagination.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The absence of the burro is 
    strikingly evident in the lush growth of bunch grasses everywhere (species 
    unknown). Burros do indeed have an impact.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Saw 2 species of plants 
    blooming today; one specimen of loco weed and an unknown 5 petaled 
    perennial. Will try to press a specimen and identify later.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In rained today, starting just 
    before we arrived, for about an hour. The best possible omen! All the colors 
    were vibrantly muted like velvet, and as we walked up Fossil Canyon, 
    exploring to the seep spring at its head, the sun broke through the clouds 
    just as it went over the rim.&nbsp; Magnificent.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Conveniently enough, we are 
    camped in an overhang under a large rock.&nbsp; Excellent shelter and nice 
    kitchen area.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Both of us to feel very, very 
    good.</font></p>
