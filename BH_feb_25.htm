    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Today’s walk took us through 
    some truly spectacular country. &nbsp;Aztec Amphitheater has a large, main canyon 
    -- that of Royal Arch Creek -- and dozens of side canyons, which all 
    eventually drain into <u>the</u> Canyon of the Colorado. On the west side we 
    encountered several side canyons with broad, open terraces of red Supai 
    slick rock. Layered benches of reddish sandstone and fantastically carved 
    boulders and overhangs, all perched in the sun, overlooking the abyss below. 
    It was very pleasant walking, not only for the scenery, but because of the 
    ease of moving over paved, level surface.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Nearly every side canyon and 
    major tributary canyon in Aztec Amphitheater had water running, or trickling 
    over its smooth floor. Some had especially pretty falls and water slides 
    coursing into potholes of various sizes. In some of the prettiest country, 
    that on the west side, we saw numerous large pot holes, open to the sun, on 
    the broad sandstone benches. The country seemed to dry up considerably as we 
    moved on past Point Quetzal in the afternoon. Also the difficulty of walking 
    increased as the heads of the side canyons became steeper and rockier. Just 
    below Apache point was the worst. The burros made things easier, since 
    following their trails turned out to be the fastest and easiest way 
    (usually!) of moving forward. We may miss them beyond Forester Canyon, which 
    marks their western boundary. We’ve seen plenty of their sign – dung and 
    tracks, but have yet to spot any.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Tonight we are camped just 
    west of Apache Point in a side canyon. We had planned on camping on the 
    Terrace, but it is drier than we expected and we opted for the running water 
    in this canyon. Apache Terrace looks like some very interesting country for 
    exploring.&nbsp; It is very large, and out at the western point I believe one 
    could view the river.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">From our campsite we can see 
    Great Thumb Mesa almost entirely now, except for the eastern side. It looks 
    so much closer now. Hopefully we’ll be at Fossil Bay day after tomorrow, and 
    Great Thumb Spring a couple of days later. Tomorrow it’s to Forester Canyon, 
    and as far beyond as we can find water, probably not more than 6-7 miles 
    from here, but Forester is rough, which is why the burros don’t get beyond 
    it. Today we traveled 7 1/2 to 8 miles. This is of course just a figure to 
    satisfy quantitative standards, but in no way reflects the reality with 
    respect to how many steps taken up, down or around -- and believe me, most 
    of it was just that!</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our physical condition seems 
    to be improving every day, with less stiffness and soreness, and fewer 
    blisters. Morning usually finds us energetic, and we do our best and fastest 
    traveling then. By afternoon we’ve lost our edge, and we slow down and 
    settle into a persistent plodding forward.&nbsp; We are making progress, but it 
    is very hard work.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">JRS</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Good day today. Passed 
    through some magnificent scenery traversing Aztec Amphitheater. Travel was 
    largely on benches in the Supai, fine limey sandstone. Many small trickle 
    springs in the canyons (about 8) that we traversed. Also many large 
    beautiful potholes just perched above the canyon space. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Mostly we’ve been following 
    burro trails. They’re pretty good route finders; they know this country 
    better than we. Just a case of ass following ass.&nbsp; We’re getting pretty good 
    at that game ourselves though; we’re not getting stranded on the benches or 
    gaining unnecessarily altitude or having to backtrack.&nbsp; Not that it was an 
    entirely easy day though; the canyon traverses are very tedious and weary.
    </font>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">All of that stepping down 
    from rocks and bumping around has been very hard on my shoulders and back. 
    The main problem has been that my pack frame is probably too long. &nbsp;I’ve not 
    noticed it before (except on Tanner) because this is the first really heavy 
    weight of carried with it. However, there is a way of setting the shoulder 
    straps on this pack that adjusts it for a shorter person. This evening I 
    changed them around and it seems to write better. Tomorrow will tell the 
    tale.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">It was much drier around 
    Apache Point than we’d hoped it would be. It has us worried. We figure that 
    with 2 dry camps (not consecutive) we can get to Great Thumb Spring. Good, 
    we have that capacity. But if it’s very dry on the Supai side, do we have 
    enough containers to get from Great Thumb to Sinyala?&nbsp; Maybe if we’re 
    clever.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then again, the weather 
    pattern shaping up to the west looks promising. Snow?&nbsp; I surely hope so. 
    Even a 2 week blizzard. I’d much rather freeze than die of thirst. 
    Everything depends on what lies ahead, and data we do not yet have. It’s out 
    of our hands much of it ,and we’re walking the wire.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is the way, consciously 
    or not, we’ve chosen for ourselves this trip. I myself at least seem to 
    create so much more adversity than is strictly necessary. Maybe because I 
    enjoy it getting myself out of it. </font> </p>
