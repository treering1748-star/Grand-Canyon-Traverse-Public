    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Rest day today! We got up in time this morning to catch the sun rise. 
    Breakfast, break camp, and we were on the trail. Through most of the Kiabab 
    we waded through 1 to 1 1/2 ft. snow. Pretty rough walking, but the snow 
    gave out to just intermittent patches through the Coconino. We traveled 
    across Darwin Plateau around the south end of Mt. Huethawali, and are now 
    camped on Spencer Terrace. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    What country this is! The red Supai sandstone here forms broad open 
    pavements, breaking off into blocks near the edge. Spencer Terrace is less 
    than 1/4 mile wide and about 2 miles long, and is sparsely covered with 
    pinons, agave, and yucca. But most beautiful of all are the tinajas, or 
    potholes -- which give us encouragement that our route may not be so dry 
    after all; and they give us very tasty water for our canteens. Along the 
    edge of the Terrace we have found dozens of them. A couple of them are over 
    2ft. deep and 4 or 5ft. across. It is amazing that they are here at all in 
    this desert, but surely their existence is strictly ephemeral. This is the 
    wettest time of the year in the canyon, and the potholes will come and go, 
    then disappear completely in the summer heat. I am always awed by the sight 
    of water in the desert.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we are camped right next 
    to one of the prettiest tinajas. It is an unusual shape and contains perhaps 
    50 gallons. It is fully exposed to the sun, as are the others that we’ve 
    seen, yet it is nearly full despite the fact that the past five days have 
    been brilliantly sunny. When we arrived here an hour or so before noon we 
    stripped off our clothes and just basked in the sun like a couple of 
    lizards. It was so good after the past two days of bundled up winter 
    camping. We can feel our energy returning.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">From this spot we have been 
    able to view our route to Fossil Bay. Through binoculars most of the 
    Esplanade seems fairly broad with a few tight places where we’ll be on 
    slopes. There is also snow on some north facing slopes, at least to Apache 
    Point, and probably some on the east side of Forster Canyon. The section 
    from Forster to Fossil looks dry, but it is far away and snow may not be 
    visible. If we could assume that the Supai has potholes like it does here, 
    and they have the amount of water in them that these do, then we have 
    nothing to worry about. In any case, water is not going to be a pressing 
    issue until perhaps beyond Great Thumb Spring on the other side.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim and I took a walk this 
    afternoon farther out on the Terrace just to space out on the country a 
    little. We dunked ourselves in one of the potholes; not feeling too guilty 
    having done so because of the number of them. It was extremely cold water; 
    cold enough so that we stayed in for only two dunkings each, and then hopped 
    out to dry in the sun. It sure feels good getting that trail grime off my 
    body in such an invigorating way.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I was surprised on the way 
    back to camp to see two species of lizards out. I had to remind myself this 
    is still February. Jim helped me corner them, and they turned out to be a <i>
    <u>Sceloporous</u> <u>undulatus</u></i>, or fence lizard, and an <i><u>Uta</u>
    <u>stansburiana</u></i>, or desert side-blotched lizard.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">This rest day was a good idea 
    and my body is already thanking me for it. But we still have many miles to 
    go and about two weeks to do it in. We have discussed the possibility of 
    forgoing Royal Arch and Elves Chasm for time reasons, and we may.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">JRS</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely beautiful day! 
    Easy walk down to Darwin Plateau then across beneath the western side of Mt. 
    Huethawali to Spencer Terrace. We’re camped beside a large pot hole on the 
    Esplanade level of the Supai. Many, many potholes. Good omen. We even found 
    one deep enough to baptize ourselves. Cold!</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a day of rest, of 
    un-kinking. We’re in the Canyon at last!&nbsp; Getting the old Canyon feeling. 
    This is a very powerful spot, one of the most beautiful I’ve been to.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Did a little long distance 
    route inspection of Aztec Amphitheater and Fossil Bay via glasses. Can’t 
    tell much, but it does look daunting. We’ve our work cut out. All in all 
    though, I’m becoming more confident, more positive in outlook. I know it 
    will be difficult, but we have it in us, and conditions look very favorable 
    as yet.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a long day of solitude 
    for us, but broken all too frequently by air traffic, some of it way below 
    the rim, and one craft right over us. Those interruptions are the rule in 
    the Canyon these days. Yet despite that, we are perhaps, indeed likely, the 
    only human beings in several hundred (thousand?) square miles. Wonderful!</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Magnificent moon rise this 
    evening. I was struck. And the stillness at times is tangible. Sat and 
    watched the bats drink out of the pothole. Heard several rocks fall. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We are just beginning! There 
    are so many days of this magnificence ahead of us, so many more wondrous 
    miles to call this journey complete. What will we see?&nbsp; How will we do?&nbsp; I 
    boggle almost off the page as I write here, thinking about it.&nbsp; I must stop.</font></p>
