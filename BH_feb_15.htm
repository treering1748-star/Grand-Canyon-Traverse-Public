    The preparations are nearly complete.&nbsp; I have enough food for least three 
    weeks; enough that is to maintain my energy level.&nbsp; The list is roughly as 
    follows: 3lbs. rice enriched, 3lbs. rolled oats, 3lbs. granola, 2lbs. sugar 
    brown and white, 1lb. instant coffee, 3lbs. trail mix - nuts and raisins – 
    16 soup mixes -may need more, 1lb. dried apples, 1lb. dried apricots, 1lb. 
    tang, one stick margarine.&nbsp; This food will be broken up into a one week 
    supply a two weeks supply. &nbsp;The 2 week supply will be stashed an Apache 
    Point, that is if we if we can get out there.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Doug Logan has lent us his 
    climbing rope - 100ft., 6lbs. and we’ve got Suzanne’s tent should we need 
    it.&nbsp; We may decide to leave it behind and only take the fly.&nbsp; Woody Peterson 
    has lent me his small 135mm auto camera since it will be more reliable than 
    mine. 2 pair of long johns should be enough.&nbsp; I’ll leave one pair at 
    Apache.&nbsp; 4 pair of socks should also be enough.&nbsp; I’m taking along enough 
    canteen spare to carry two gallons.&nbsp; Water shouldn’t be much of a problem 
    with all the moisture lately, but we’ve marked all potholes and springs, 
    that we can dig out of the literature, on the map.&nbsp; Also taking along 
    Butchart’s book and maybe Fletcher’s.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The big problem now is 
    logistics.&nbsp; How to set the cache at Apache, and how to get out to the 
    trailhead when the roads are so bad?&nbsp; Jim called Monday night and he thinks 
    a four wheel is necessary.&nbsp; I’ve postponed going over to the Canyon till 
    Friday in hopes things will improve.&nbsp; I’m kinda regretting waiting now since 
    things haven’t really improved.&nbsp; If we can just get below the rim at Bass I 
    think everything will be all right.&nbsp; We thought about all the hardships 
    we’re going to face in the Canyon and I feel prepared and willing to face 
    them.&nbsp; This problem with the roads, however, seems perhaps larger than it 
    is.&nbsp; I haven’t seen them yet of course but it seems that they should improve 
    going out because of less traffic farther away from Grand Canyon Village.&nbsp; 
    Also, there’s another road out to Bass which follows the Park-Forest 
    boundary fence - it may be in better shape.&nbsp; It’s just a little frustrating 
    sitting here and not being able to do anything about it.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">When Jim called he was a 
    little less than optimistic, but still reassuring that he still wants to 
    make the original trip.&nbsp; I think his energy is just at a low point because 
    he’s just getting over the flu and he’s had to fight those roads between the 
    cabin and the Village.&nbsp; Cold weather also has the effect of damping any will 
    get out in it.&nbsp; I’m pretty sure at this point that at least part of our 
    journey will be in foul weather.&nbsp; No doubt there will be cold nights and 
    mornings, but we’ll adjust.&nbsp; The physical aches and pains will initially 
    occupy our minds, but with time I know they fade.&nbsp; When I think about it, 
    our so called hardships were common place to thousands who explored and 
    traveled the west.&nbsp; In fact, they were probably much more difficult.&nbsp; 
    Consider that we have lightweight aluminum and nylon backpacks, and dried 
    and instant foods, down clothing and sleeping bags, and dozens of other 
    handy, efficient devices.&nbsp; Compare this with frameless, (shoulder bruising) 
    packs, hardtack and beans and coffee, and a wool blanket, and sometimes much 
    less, &nbsp;that old-timers made do on for months at a time.&nbsp; This is a 
    perspective we should keep in mind.&nbsp; We cannot expect to be physically 
    comfortable on a trip of this nature, and that isn’t the purpose of the trip 
    anyway.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">There are many bugs yet to be 
    worked out in the plans, including the logistics and timing.&nbsp; I should be 
    back before the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of March.&nbsp; But things will work out.&nbsp; I 
    remain flexible.&nbsp; My mind is set on going around Great Thumb, but if it’s 
    not feasible, there are other trips we can make.&nbsp; It remains to be seen.
