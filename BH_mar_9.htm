    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Lazy day today. We got up late and the skies were gray, but soon it cleared 
    up and we’ve had sun with high altitude clouds all day. We took a walk down 
    to Mooney falls and as far as the first river crossing below.&nbsp; Havasu Creek 
    is in flood stage right now it is a chocolate brown instead of its usual 
    turquoise blue. It’s also about three times as big as it normally as, or at 
    least how I remember it. I guess it was about four years ago that I was last 
    here.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">It has been sort of anti 
    climactic arriving here. Today we just laid around in the sun, dreaming 
    about the reunion with the ladies, showers, clean clothes, and beer. We are 
    ready to come out and start up our lives in that other world. The 
    realization that we have done what we’ve done has not fully crystallized.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow -- on up to the top. 
    It’s a little over ten miles, but with our packs empty or nearly so, we 
    should clip off the miles quickly. We planned our food well. We have enough 
    oatmeal for couple more meals, and enough rice for the same. We have a few 
    other odds and ends of things, enough to last a couple of days if necessary, 
    but all in all it was pretty close to accurate planning. We’ve purchased a 
    few “luxuries” here at the Supai trading store -- sardines and soda pop and 
    an ice cream cone. Ahhh, the comforts of civilization.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">JRS&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">A day at Supai. We went down 
    below Mooney Falls and poked around a bit. Looked up a side canyon that went 
    back about a quarter mile and fetched up against a 100ft. chute in the 
    Redwall. Spectacular.&nbsp; The forces of water; how they carved channels like 
    these. There were numerous travertine pools and of deep, clear water.&nbsp; There 
    were ferns growing green against the Redwall. It was an enchanted place.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;The water here is not the 
    pale blue I had come to expect from pictures since the river is in flood 
    stage and is a muddy torrent. Still the effect of the travertine formations 
    and the beauty of the falls was not exaggerated. It is a paradise.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;We toyed with the idea of 
    climbing the scaffold to the Bridal Veil mind, but in the end did not. We 
    are both kind of burned out by now, and don’t feel like doing much of 
    anything really. To tell the truth were a little bored.&nbsp; Spent much of the 
    afternoon sleeping in the sun.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;Two Supai came down to visit 
    us, hoping for a joint, but we had none to give them. What Supai needs is a 
    good reliable dealer. We talked with them, though, for a long time and as it 
    turned out we had many mutual acquaintances. One of them named Don knew Deb 
    and most of the Tusayan crowd, and of course Eric. We’ve met a lot of Supai 
    down here and most of them seem to know him. They asked us how we came down, 
    and rather than lie, we just told them the truth. It didn’t seem to faze 
    them a bit. I had been led to believe that it would be much more touchy 
    subject than has turned out. Perhaps the average Supai doesn’t really give a 
    shit.&nbsp; Or perhaps the ones we’ve talked to were just ignorant of the 
    situation.&nbsp; I don’t know. Anyway, it looks as if we’ve gotten away with it, 
    and with a minimal amount of lying. Perhaps we’ve been overly paranoid all 
    long.&nbsp; Perhaps we’ve just been lucky.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;So much for Supai. I am just 
    too saturated with canyon sweat right now, and I’m ready for trail’s end. 
    The next time I come down here will be able to give it more attention.&nbsp; It 
    is a beautiful place.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;Tomorrow: up and out.</font></p>
