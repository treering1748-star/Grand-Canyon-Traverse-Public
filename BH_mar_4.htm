    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    It was not sunny today. In fact if anything this is the worst weather we’ve 
    had yet. There is all the discomfort of rain and mud, with the added misery 
    of high winds. The disappointment was tangible, and our dispositions have 
    suffered; we’ve started snapping at each other. It looks as if the weather 
    will continue this way for the remainder of our trip and we’re about ready 
    to get it all over with.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The 
    overhang we slept in last night was miserable shelter; the wind and rain 
    just funneled in on us, and we agreed it would be pointless to spend the day 
    there hunkered and shivering around a smoky fire. So we set off, all grim 
    determination, for Chickapanagi Point, &nbsp;9-10 miles off. We stopped only once 
    near Hamidrik Point for lunch out of the wind in an overhang, by three large 
    mescal pits. This crude shelter had been improved by the addition of three 
    rock partitions. On the rock wall were painted 2 symbols, only one of which 
    was still legible:&nbsp; </font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><a href="images/BH-PG0009s.jpg">
    <img border="2" src="images/BH-PG0009s_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="BH-PG0009s.jpg" width="100" height="73"></a></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We made it around the 
    amphitheater by the same old routine; the endless going around, detours 
    around the dichotomies of drainage.&nbsp; The endless hairslipping heads of 
    canyons.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We are so heartily sick of 
    that, that we have decided to try bypassing the majority of Matkatamiba, 
    that stretches out before us, and try the route down the Sinyala fault 
    ravine. Even if this route is very difficult, without actually being 
    impossible, it should take us no longer than going around, and it will be a 
    welcome change of pace from the type of walking we’ve been doing.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We saw 2 wild horses this day. 
    Supai escapees? I suspect most of the trails we’ve been following are horse 
    trails, since they are very broad and droppings and tracks are larger than 
    what you’d expect from burros.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">There is another large mescal 
    pit in the canyon beneath us. One wonders what these people used for fuel, 
    since we have found it very difficult finding firewood. I suspect that these 
    terraces once had stands of pinon and juniper that are now gone.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    We awoke to disappointment this morning. We were hoping for sunny weather, 
    in fact expecting it, since we saw all the signs yesterday. Men who predict 
    the weather are often fools. We decided not to spend our rest day under a 
    windy overhang (which brought in droplets of rain) instead we’d as soon be 
    out on the trail walking. We got going about late morning, procrastinating 
    as much as we could -- our bodies did not want out in that rain. We lucked 
    out in finding good burro trails all morning.&nbsp; They took us through some 
    rough parts quickly and efficiently, but they disappeared altogether in some 
    others.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We walked off about three 
    miles or so, until we were near the main bed of Olo Canyon, where we crossed 
    three large mescal pits and the remains of an overhang-rock shelter. It was 
    a relief to get out of the rain and the driving winds, which played havoc 
    with our ponchos. On the back wall of the shelter were two symbols:&nbsp; 
    <a href="images/BH-PG0010s.jpg">
    <img border="2" src="images/BH-PG0010s_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="BH-PG0010s.jpg" width="100" height="68"></a>&nbsp; -- maybe clan symbols?&nbsp; Also, there was one curl of a 
    bighorn. How it got there is puzzling.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">From the overhang-rock shelter 
    we walked on past Hamidrik Peak and nonstop to our campsite here on 
    Chickapanagi Mesa. About nine miles. It was quick hiking, taking us only 
    about 3 hours total. It was coming down pretty hard when we got here, and we 
    set out to find a nice overhang. We walked down several side canyons and 
    even the Sinyala fault ravine -- all Supai terrace country, and still didn’t 
    come up with a decent place until at last, after a couple extra miles of 
    walking, found this overhang. From here we look into a small side canyon 
    with a large mescal pit against the far side. There is also a small one on 
    the terrace above us. It seems we are continually camping near them, or 
    coming by them on the trail.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim and I are talking now of 
    the possibility of taking the fault ravine through Matkatamiba. Maybe.
    </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We’re getting closer every day 
    to Supai. We figure we could make it in two long days if we like. If the 
    weather continues as such, we may as well.</font></p>
