    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Today did not quite fit 
    expectations. I foresaw an easy 8 or 9 miles to Supai. Well, it was easy 
    enough the first 6 or so, then one boondoggle after another. We started down 
    the first side canyon which comes into Havasu Canyon just above Mooney Falls 
    in a state of excitement --- we’d be in Supai in minutes enjoying a cold 
    soda pop. Wrong!&nbsp; The canyon ended up dropping down increasingly large drop 
    offs, one of which we roped our packs down. We came to another 50ft. drop 
    and could see an even larger one further down, and decided we’d have to turn 
    around.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a steep, hard-earned 
    1/2 mile or so back up to the head of the canyon, back on the Esplanade and 
    another mile around a point and down into Carbonate Canyon. Carbonate soon 
    took on the characteristics of the first side canyon. Drop offs. We lowered 
    our packs twice and labored over and down through the Supai formation to the 
    Redwall. We started down the narrow chute through the Redwall, climbing down 
    several falls before we found a large pool at the base of a drop off, and 
    we’d have to swim to go farther. Back up to the top of the Redwall. Here, to 
    our relief was a well marked trail that took us to just below Supai village 
    about at Navaho Falls. I should’ve remembered that the village is up the 
    canyon on top of the Redwall shelf, and the falls drop through the Redwall 
    below.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We met several Supai on the 
    way into the village coming from Carbonate. It must have looked pretty 
    suspicious to see a couple of turkeys coming from that direction, instead of 
    the usual one down the trail. They asked where we were coming from and we 
    gave a vague reply of “from down the canyon”. They seemed slightly amazed. 
    Our paranoia that they might be upset may be unjustified. &nbsp;Anyway, we got 
    our reservations. $9.00 apiece for two days. Expensive but I can’t blame 
    them – I’d give us the shaft too if I were them. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">It has been a long day and 
    frustrating one. Perhaps the most frustrating and scary, but sitting here 
    thinking about it, it was a suitable obstacle and fitting challenge to 
    overcome in coming off the Esplanade.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I talked to Suzanne on the 
    phone.&nbsp; She’s going to try and come out and meet us at Hualapai Hilltop with 
    Deb. &nbsp;Glory!&nbsp; Glory!</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">JRS&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">A harder day than we thought. 
    It went well enough on the Esplanade, and we made good time being as we were 
    in top shape and with light packs. For our descent into Havasu canyon we 
    elected to try the unnamed canyon just north of Carbonate. This we thought 
    would save us a couple of miles. This was a mistake. We had worked our way 
    down barely a half mile before we were utterly stopped by a sheer wall of 
    about 50-60ft. in a light colored layer of the Supai. Much frustration. In 
    very poor spirits, we retraced our steps then tediously worked our way up to 
    the head of Carbonate. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;Somehow, both of us were 
    under the impression that the last few miles to Supai were going to be a 
    stroll. Not so. Carbonate Canyon was one was one of the hardest physical 
    obstacles we have had to negotiate. We had to lower our packs twice to 
    scramble down cliffs, finger and toe. We were in a very frayed condition, 
    being tired and frustrated. This was a dangerous frame of mind, for it made 
    us impatient and we hurried and took unnecessary chances. We were somewhat 
    encouraged by the presence of cairn markers indicating that someone had it 
    least pioneered a climber’s route. However when we got to the Redwall we 
    must have missed them, because we laboriously descended this formation about 
    1/4 mile before being halted by a steep chute with a deep pot hole at the 
    bottom. Back up again, cursing all the way. At the top of the Redwall we 
    discovered the cairns we had missed, and the rest of the way was easy, on 
    well traveled trail all the way to Supai.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;We encountered several Supais 
    along the way and all of them asked basically the same two questions “Can 
    you spare a joint?”&nbsp; and “Which way did you come?”&nbsp; Apparently there is 
    quite a dope drought in Supai at present. We had none to spare. As for the 
    second question, our carefully prepared lies fell apart as we spoke them; 
    neither Tommy nor I are good liars at all. In the end, we just told part of 
    the truth; that we came from down canyon and had been hiking many days. This 
    last was obvious in any event. None of them seemed terribly bothered by it.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;We were asked no questions at 
    all though in the tourist office. Our reservations were in order, and we 
    just paid our money.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;I called the Shell station 
    and word for Deb to pick us up on the 10<sup>th</sup>, and Tom called 
    Suzanne and she said she’d be there at the top also. It will be a fine 
    reunion.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;We are very tired this 
    evening. After a meal of beans (store bought food!), bread, cheese, and coke 
    (junk food!) we should sleep good. (The mosquitoes are very bad here.)</font></p>
