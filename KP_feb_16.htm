    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;Unsuccessful day.&nbsp; We were 
    hoping that one of the arms of Deer Creek northeast of Vaughn Spring would 
    contain a route onto the Esplanade.&nbsp; Butchart said there was a route in the 
    northeast arm, but was ambiguous about which one.&nbsp; Apparently he meant the 
    other because it sure wasn’t the one we tried.&nbsp; About 1/4 mile from the fork 
    we were stopped by a deep plunge pool in the Redwall.&nbsp; There was a crack to 
    the left, about a 30ft. pitch.&nbsp; Both Tom and I tried it but could only get 
    up halfway.&nbsp; We could have managed it under other circumstances, I believe, 
    but there was too much hanging in the balance.&nbsp; Even a sprained ankle this 
    deep in the canyon would be a disaster.&nbsp; We also had no assurance that the 
    route would go any further past the bottom two pitches.&nbsp; I must admit I was 
    scared when I made my attempt.&nbsp; It was beyond me this day.&nbsp; We turned our 
    backs on it.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We spent a couple hours 
    fishing in the afternoon, and our luck held true.&nbsp; No fish.&nbsp; The river is up 
    about 4ft. from yesterday and the creek mouth is a totally different place.&nbsp; 
    I don’t know if that’s why they weren’t biting, or if other factors are at 
    play.&nbsp; Fish are capricious creatures.&nbsp; Perhaps the gods are angry with us.&nbsp;
    </font>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We went through our food bags 
    and came up with about four days.&nbsp; Not enough, yet close enough to being 
    adequate that we agonized a long time about spending another day’s time and 
    effort tomorrow attempting to recover the cache by the trail.&nbsp; And that, I’m 
    afraid, is what we’re going to do.&nbsp; This shouldn’t throw us seriously off 
    schedule, but it will be a considerable effort, no laughing matter.&nbsp; It has 
    cast us into a slump and we need a success to pull us out of it.&nbsp;
    </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow we’ll break camp and 
    move up into Surprise Valley.&nbsp; We’ll empty our packs and hike, about 12 
    miles one way, to the cache and back all in one day.&nbsp; It makes me tired 
    thinking about it.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The weather remains gray, 
    though the overcast is thinner and there have been some brief breaks.&nbsp; The 
    winds and clouds were coming out of the west yesterday evening when a 
    clearing trend was noted, Orion appearing for a time in his entirety. &nbsp;But 
    now they are out of the southwest again and merely seem to tease us with 
    faint and ephemeral patches of blue here and there.&nbsp; Some sunlight would 
    certainly do wonders for our morale.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We caught a view of Great 
    Thumb today from the upper canyon.&nbsp; We could see Great Thumb and Tahuta 
    Points, lightly snow covered.&nbsp; Could also see Powell Plateau from the river, 
    no longer misty, but apparently deep in snow.&nbsp; Looked cold.&nbsp;
    </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We reconnoitered this evening 
    looking for a trail or route to Surprise Valley.&nbsp; We did not find so much as 
    a trace, though we traversed the entire east side of the valley as far as 
    the spring before it got too dark to proceed.&nbsp; The route, we feel, must go 
    up the canyon above Deer Spring.&nbsp; Unfortunately we did not get far enough to 
    ascertain this.&nbsp; We should have taken the time to do this yesterday.&nbsp; But 
    what good is hindsight to us now? &nbsp;In any event were going to head up and 
    out that way tomorrow and if it doesn’t work will try a possible route Tommy 
    spotted along a ledge traversing Cogswell Butte.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">This has been a day of great 
    uncertainties.&nbsp; Still nothing is resolved.&nbsp; All we can do is persevere and 
    proceed.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">TWS</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">This morning found us headed 
    up Deer Creek -- once more boulder hopping.&nbsp; The great red walls closed in 
    on both sides up at Vaughn Spring and our planned route up the left NE fork 
    came to an abrupt halt. &nbsp;The creek bed turned into chute winding through the 
    limestone.&nbsp; Typical Redwall pattern -- winding narrow channels with wall to 
    wall pools – deep pools with boulder chalk stones above.&nbsp; Impassable.&nbsp; Or as 
    much Butchart says, “impossible without hardware”.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We tried though.&nbsp; A narrow 
    crack through the limestone led up and onto a huge Redwall slab leaning away 
    from the left hand wall.&nbsp; It looked like it <u>may</u> get us up and over 
    this section.&nbsp; The uncertainty of it all shook my resolve and I had no will 
    to climb.&nbsp; When I was all roped up and ready I couldn’t even begin the 
    pitch.&nbsp; It’s a tough little climb, something Jim and I know we could do, but 
    it wasn’t worth the risk -- to us and the whole trip.&nbsp; We just weren’t sure 
    if this was the route Butchart described (ambiguously) or not, or if there 
    were greater or more obstacles ahead.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Now are planning for a long 
    day tomorrow to retrieve the cache and return to Surprise Valley.&nbsp; Our 
    dwindling food supplies would make it imperative to reach the Bass cache 
    without delay.&nbsp; Another risk we won’t take when food waits within reach from 
    here.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our setback today and in 
    being unable to make it to the cache lent a sobering effect on us.&nbsp; Worry 
    and concern.&nbsp; Homesickness and missing our babies and ladies always brings 
    on the question faced by all adventurers and explorers I’m sure: “What am I 
    doing here?”&nbsp; It seems that the most obvious thing and most important is -- 
    just to make it.&nbsp; To complete the trip, to survive, to meet the challenge.&nbsp;
