    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;I write now from the warmth 
    and security of Mauve Cabin.&nbsp; Yesterday, the 20<sup>th</sup>, was our 
    hardest day yet.&nbsp; We climbed up Saddle Canyon the mile or so separating our 
    camp of the night before and the full ramp leading up to the Redwall.&nbsp; We 
    climbed our way up the ramp mostly on hands and knees using the thick brush 
    as handholds up the 100% + slope.&nbsp; It had rained all night and sporadic 
    rainfall would continue to come down on us all day.&nbsp; Our clothing was soaked 
    by the time we reached the climbing section of the ramp, and it was most 
    cold and trying of patience as we managed the rope to haul up the packs.&nbsp; My 
    pack was especially difficult, seeming to hang up on every rock protrubence 
    and bit of brush.&nbsp; Once up and over the difficult section we had to claw our 
    way up the rest of the ramp to the top.&nbsp; We were then about 1000ft. above 
    our last night’s camp, but another 600ft. or so of Supai sandstone was yet 
    to be climbed before we could reach the Esplanade and our traverse route.&nbsp;
    </font>
    </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The next hour we climbed 
    mostly with our packs on, traversing between Supai ledges until we could 
    find the cracks we could climb up. &nbsp;Finally we made the last ledge before 
    the top, and a particularly hard climb forced us to drop packs and haul them 
    up with rope.&nbsp; On top of the Esplanade we looked straight across to Mauve -- 
    it appeared to be so close.&nbsp; We found an overhang and with much difficulty 
    got a fire going.&nbsp; We needed something warm to drink badly.&nbsp; The rain had 
    turned to snow, and wind had picked up.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">After a can of tuna and a cup 
    of hot chocolate we set out again to work our way around to the saddle.&nbsp; The 
    Esplanade in this section was covered heavily with pinon, juniper and 
    brush.&nbsp; Down on the slick rock, paved ledges we slogged through sections of 
    ankle-deep mud.&nbsp; In one spot we found numerous flakes, and a few steps 
    further and both Jim and I each found a point.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">About two miles from the 
    Saddle we encountered thick brush -- manzanita and bear berry, and we 
    literally had to fight our way forward for every step.&nbsp; For the most part we 
    were contouring on steep slopes.&nbsp; Mud and snow continually would slide out 
    beneath us.&nbsp; Finally we made it around the corner, but we weren’t there 
    yet.&nbsp; The actual ridge line of the saddle was still up at the very head of 
    Saddle Canyon.&nbsp; We couldn’t see how far it was snowing, and we were fairly 
    well socked in.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">At this point we were very 
    tired.&nbsp; It was late afternoon, we had climbed over 2000ft. and 7 long miles 
    of slope and brush in the rain, but our spirits were high -- we must be so 
    close to the cabin.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We set out up the canyon and 
    soon came into deep snow and thicker brush.&nbsp; We struggled along through 
    drifts above the knees weaving in and out of the thickets.&nbsp; Each ridge 
    coming down from the canyon side seemed to be the one, and then topping over 
    it we’d see yet another up ahead, a little higher.&nbsp; We continued till both 
    of us realized that exhaustion was near, and our situation was beginning to 
    look serious.&nbsp; We knew we were close to the cabin, but headway through the 
    snow and brush was getting harder and harder.&nbsp; We were both soaked to the 
    bone.&nbsp; We hadn’t had a significant meal all day and energy reserves were 
    very low. &nbsp;We were starting to shiver.&nbsp; I suggested we drop packs to head up 
    to find the cabin, get warm and return.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our packs off we were able to 
    move much quicker up the draw, and about 1/3 of a mile further up we spotted 
    the cabin.&nbsp; Frankly -- I was disappointed -- the stove is an old handmade 
    job that smokes and has been mistreated into almost 0 efficiency (if it ever 
    was), and the food supplies that the back country ranger mentioned turned 
    out to be assorted reject food left here by backpackers for the last 7 
    years.&nbsp; Well, we didn’t get warm or eat, but now we were sure the cabin was 
    here.&nbsp; From sunlight off the Coconino way down canyon we could see that 
    sunset wasn’t far off.&nbsp; We trudged down to the packs, grabbed our bags and 
    clothes, and got back to the cabin just at dark.&nbsp; It was a close call. &nbsp;If 
    the cabin had been much further, our survival -- outside with wet clothes 
    and our state of exhaustion -- would’ve been very doubtful.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Today (the 21<sup>st</sup> ) 
    looks much better. &nbsp;Our clothes dry (slowly) over the stove.&nbsp; We’ve eaten 
    hearty and Jim even produced 13 tortillas from the cached flour.&nbsp; The cabin 
    is warm even though it’s something of a blizzard outside.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Our stay in here and Mauve 
    Cabin has been very productive.&nbsp; Clothes, backpacks and gear all dried.&nbsp; 
    Packs and clothes mended.&nbsp; Good food and lots of hot drink have raised our 
    spirits and energy levels.&nbsp; We have made it, and we still have our 
    determination.&nbsp; The Canyon has tested our resolve and spirit again.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">A short reconnoiter this 
    afternoon showed the trail leading from in back of the cabin to the break in 
    the Coconino.&nbsp; We can descend here whatever the weather.&nbsp; Tomorrow begins a 
    new effort to reach and get over Flint Saddle, and to see all the country 
    between here and there.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">JRS</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Mauve Saddle.&nbsp; It was brutal 
    work getting here.&nbsp; It nearly finished us.&nbsp; When we got here I was soaked 
    thoroughly and shivering, even after exertion.&nbsp; Night was coming and the 
    weather was very bad.&nbsp; Knee deep snow, near impenetrable brush and a saddle 
    that seemed to keep receding from us.&nbsp; Many times I was sure we were nearly 
    there only to find the saddle was still further.&nbsp; And the brush! Oak 
    thickets, manzanita and locust -- a jungle. &nbsp;And here we are, slogging 
    through snow on top of this shit, after a long hard day of hiking.&nbsp;
    </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">To start the morning we 
    climbed through the Redwall, a couple of grade 5 pitches, and scrambled up 
    the ravine about 800ft.&nbsp; Very difficult hauling the packs up after us.&nbsp; Then 
    another 500ft. or so in the Supai, more scrambling and grade 5 climbing.&nbsp; By 
    this time we were already soaked, and so with considerable trouble (and 
    precious gas) we got a fire started under an overhang.&nbsp; An hours rest and we 
    were off again, mud slogging and underbrush fighting.&nbsp; Damned hard hiking, 
    damned hard.&nbsp; It sure took the wind out of us.&nbsp; We were so down in 
    exhaustion and depression, we bitched and snapped at each other all day. By 
    the time we got here we were on the thin line.&nbsp; I, at least, was fighting 
    for survival.&nbsp; After we abandoned our packs I was running on emergency 
    reserve.&nbsp; If the cabin was a half mile further, or it had taken us another 
    half hour to find it, I might not have been able to continue.&nbsp; I couldn’t 
    stop moving, even for a few minutes, I was so cold I might not have been 
    able to start again.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">There was little jubilation 
    when we reached the cabin.&nbsp; We were too depleted, and all we could do was 
    start a fire, warm up for a few minutes, then head back the 1/3 mile or so 
    to our packs for sleeping bags and dry clothes.&nbsp; With a broken trail and 
    light load, we managed handily, but even so it was rapidly getting dark when 
    we got back.&nbsp; We spent a crude primitive evening huddled over this barely 
    functional stove and griped at each other over a guttering, improvised 
    candle.&nbsp; This the highest point in elevation we will reach; it was a severe 
    low point for our morale.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Today (21<sup>st</sup> ) we 
    have got it back together again. Our clothes are dry, or nearly so, the 
    cabin is warm, and we’ve been pigging out.&nbsp; Gathered firewood, melted snow, 
    and guzzled hot drinks all day.&nbsp; Made a baker’s dozen tortillas. &nbsp;Patched a 
    hole I burnt in my pants, and improvised a fine pair of gaiters from an old 
    nylon tarp I found in the attic.&nbsp; This cabin, primitive though it is, saved 
    our lives.&nbsp; We will be able to head out tomorrow replenished with dry 
    clothes on our bodies and in our packs.&nbsp; It’ll be hard no doubt since the 
    trail is overgrown, and nothing about this hike has been easy.&nbsp; The weather 
    will probably remain terrible.&nbsp; As I write this we’re socked in solid, it’s 
    snowing, and there’s a howling wind.&nbsp; Great conditions.&nbsp; But we’ll be going 
    downhill tomorrow, dropping quickly (I hope) below the snow belt to what 
    we’re more used to, and better able to cope with -- cold rain.&nbsp; I really 
    believe the worst is behind us, mainly because it’s difficult to imagine 
    much worse conditions ahead.&nbsp; </font> </p>
