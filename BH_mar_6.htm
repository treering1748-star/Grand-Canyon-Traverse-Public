    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I got up the morning feeling 
    pretty negative. It rained again last night an the skies were gray and 
    threatening. The limestone overhang we stayed under dripped continually so 
    we had to set the tent up inside, with only Jim’s poncho. It didn’t work 
    that great and my sleeping bag ended up getting pretty wet. This is the 
    tenth day of rain and it does get tiring.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;We got going, and by the time 
    we reached the fault ravine on the west side the sun was out and our spirits 
    were up. It was work coming up, as the bed of the ravine was littered with 
    gigantic boulders, and in places there were waterfalls and cascades.&nbsp; We got 
    around all of these easy enough on the talus slopes to the right or left. 
    The last few steps of the climb rewarded us with a magnificent view of Mount 
    Sinyala, straight ahead and now only a couple of miles distant across 
    Sinyala Canyon. A fault ravine cuts down again here into Sinyala Canyon and 
    emerges in a line on the other side. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;Fine country. The saddle 
    between the west fault ravine of Matkatamiba and the east side of Sinyala 
    Canyon is where we are camped. There’s a couple of mescal pits here and lots 
    of nice overhangs, which the Indians obviously used. Within an hour or so of 
    looking we found a half dozen arrowheads and several scrapers. Some of the 
    points are very tiny and delicate. Jim found one that’s only about 1/4in. 
    long. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;We went out to a point on 
    Matkatamiba Mesa overlooking Sinyala Canyon and watched the sunset.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">JRS</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We’ve made it out of 
    Matkatamiba today via the Sinyala fault. It was steep and rough -- but 
    short, only a mile or so. Where the fault canyon started into the Redwall we 
    found a mescal pit, and at the top in the saddle between Sinyala and 
    Matkatamiba Canyons we found a larger one, plus several shelter sites, one 
    of them tagged with a number: AZ.;B;10;90 May 13,76. The sites were very 
    rich in chippings and shards, old corncobs, and points. I found a very nice 
    thumb scraper and two perfect, tiny points no bigger than my little finger. 
    We both caught the arrowhead bug and spent hours this afternoon with our 
    noses to the ground.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The weather was wet this 
    morning and last night, and we both had wet sleeping bags despite tent and 
    cave. The clouds cleared up largely by this afternoon and we were able to 
    dry our possessions, and, glory!&nbsp; Bathe! It was a renewal.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">It is good to be back on the 
    Esplanade. Mt. Sinyala looms to the west, a very impressive sight, and the 
    Sinyala fault almost seems to point to it. This is a focus of a sort, this 
    place. I feel it from the logic of the landscape, the way it lies; I feel it 
    from the Indian site and the mescal pit, their placement here in the saddle; 
    I feel it in the weather which, at last, is beginning to change for real.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The mescal pit. How often this 
    trip we’ve camped and camped in the best places, beside a mescal pit. The 
    former inhabitants of this country, this canyon, have been with us 
    constantly. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I have an impression of 
    Matkatamiba I haven’t recorded yet. We walked down the canyon as it deepened 
    and narrowed, burrowing into the red wall.&nbsp; That rock polished white and 
    gray blue was just beginning to be stained its Redwall color and streamers 
    as the Supai bled down onto it.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I think we were spotted by a 
    plane today, here on the saddle. The sum bitch flew near over us eastward on 
    his trip out (it was a turkey tour) are then on the way back he came zooming 
    over a ridge directly over our heads and very low, as if he wanted to catch 
    us by surprise. Asshole.</font></p>
