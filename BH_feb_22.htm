    <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    Another hard day!&nbsp; I write now by candlelight, in the tent, twenty yards 
    from the Canyon rim at Bass Camp. Today we walked 7 1/2 miles, but it felt 
    like 20. We made our way from the last camp to Turquoise Canyon, then cross 
    country to the road connecting Signal Hill with Bass. We arrived here maybe 
    an hour after the sun’s zenith. We were very tired then, but we still 
    planned to make it down to the Esplanade after lunch. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I discovered that, of 
    all things, I was missing my sweater!&nbsp; Jim and I were both beginning to 
    wonder when things were going to go right. On top of other things, we both 
    were getting concerned that perhaps we hadn’t brought along enough water 
    containers. The Esplanade from here shows dry sections (long ones!) where 
    they are exposed to the sun -- but there is snow in the protected side 
    canyons. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">I decided that I should make 
    an effort to find my sweater since it was handmade by Suzanne, and it meant 
    a great deal to me. After retracing my steps about three miles I decided to 
    turn back, the sun was setting, and my energies were at minimum. Every step 
    I took back I realized I would have to travel again back to Bass. About two 
    miles from Turquoise I turned around and said goodbye to my sweater for 
    good. It hurts!&nbsp; But worse things could happen. </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Around the fire tonight Jim 
    and I discussed our bad luck and we have resolved to place ourselves closer 
    in touch with the realities and dangers of this trip. We plan on a rest day 
    tomorrow after hiking down to Spencer Terrace. Hopefully we can find the 
    power and energy to avoid more bad luck. Certainly more caution, planning 
    and meditation will help.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">As I write I can feel the 
    tiredness and aching in my muscles and bones, yet I have a positive and 
    optimistic viewpoint. I’m sure that this trip will require more of my 
    reserves before it is through, but I know I’ll come away with extra.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">JRS</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Trying day today. The going 
    was very hard; much cross country work through snowdrifts and sagebrush. No 
    mud at least. A very long 7-8 miles. Got our first view of the canyon today, 
    looking down Turquoise Canyon. From there we lost the jeep trail to Signal 
    Hill and began bushwhacking the long stretch. I thought we’d never make it. 
    From the Signal Hill road to Bass Camp it was easier, and we discovered the 
    remains of a shack and cistern about 1/2 way. &nbsp;One thing about starting a 
    trip this way is that you certainly see a lot of country you never would 
    have otherwise.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We made it here to Bass Camp, 
    but have gotten no further. Many bad, miasmic apprehensions have surfaced.&nbsp; 
    Have we enough water containers? Will it be too dry? Have we offended the 
    Canyon spirits? We managed to find one leaky old plastic milk bottle with no 
    lid that may do a pinch, but while attaching it to Tom’s pack discovered he 
    had lost the sweater Suzanne had made him. Very, very sad. He, exhausted 
    though he was, backtracked 6 miles, but could not find it. We’ve been doing 
    something wrong.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In all, I think it was well 
    that we were forced to camp here tonight, still above the rim. It has made 
    us to reconsider our goal and the dangers involved. We are more in tune with 
    the realities, and hopefully more on our toes. The whole undertaking now 
    appears much larger than it did it first. I am chastened and humbled, no 
    longer so overconfident. Yet, I think we will make it.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow we shall rise early 
    and greet the sun. We shall humble ourselves by the sight of the canyon. We 
    shall make a paho and symbolically place it and ourselves at the mercy of 
    the Grand Canyon spirits.</font></p>
