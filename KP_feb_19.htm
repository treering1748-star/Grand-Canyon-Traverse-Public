    2/19 followed the steep benches on the left side above the Tapeats Creek 
    narrows, up and around Tapeats Spring 
    which is in a canyon entering from the left in about the middle of this 
    scene. Too much fast 
    water in Tapeats Creek precluded walking/climbing&nbsp; up through the 
    narrows. Crazy Jug Canyon is around the corner at the far upper right.</font></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Mouth of Crazy Jug.&nbsp; We’re 
    camped right on the Mauve Fault.&nbsp; The route through the Redwall south of us 
    is a classic fault ravine, nearly vertical, but it goes.&nbsp; Tomas scouted it 
    today after we got here this afternoon.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We had another fairly 
    difficult day.&nbsp; Contouring around and above the Tapeats to Tapeats Spring 
    was tedious and took a lot out of us, even though it was only about 4 
    miles.&nbsp; We had to ford the stream coming from Tapeats Spring and I got wet 
    above my waist.&nbsp; It is a swift, vicious creek, this Tapeats Creek.&nbsp; There’s 
    a lot of water in this canyon.&nbsp; After Tapeats Spring we stayed in the creek 
    bed.&nbsp; Another 3-4 miles of fairly easy stream bed work.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">We built camp, then did our 
    exploring.&nbsp; I walked up Saddle Canyon thinking it was a fault ravine, but 
    could only get up about 1/2 mile.&nbsp; First I was halted for a while by 100ft. 
    waterfall that had a ramp leading to a ledge above it. &nbsp;Then I was stopped 
    for good by a puny 20ft. double falls through a slick rock chute.&nbsp; We’ll go 
    no further up Saddle Canyon.&nbsp; Looks like the fault ravine is a go for 
    tomorrow.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The weather is atrocious. 
    Hard cold rain nearly constant.&nbsp; Waterfalls off the Redwall.&nbsp; The stove 
    don’t work and it’s almost impossible to build a fire to dry our clothes.&nbsp; 
    Other than that, everything’s just fine.&nbsp; </font> </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;All morning we worked our 
    way around up and over Thunder River and Tapeats Creek narrows.&nbsp; We were 
    finally able to get off the Precambrian bench and drop down to creek level 
    just below Tapeats Spring.&nbsp; The water there runs fast, and there’s a lot of 
    it.&nbsp; Jim and I worked our way down but eventually had to just walk into the 
    fast flowing current to ford, rather than risk life and limb boulder hopping 
    with 50lb. packs.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">A couple of hard hours 
    climbing up Tapeats Creek bed brought us here to the fault line.&nbsp; Crazy Jug 
    Canyon runs north from here above our camp.&nbsp; Saddle Canyon and the ramp to 
    the top of the Redwall are just around the bend from here.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">This afternoon with camp set 
    up Jim and I reconnoitered our route tomorrow.&nbsp; The fault here breaks the 
    Redwall into a steep ramp with vegetation growing all the way up and several 
    bands of harder rock standing out as “climbing” sections.&nbsp; The most 
    difficult lies at the foot of the talus and 2/3 way up.&nbsp; I climbed up around 
    with some difficulty mostly due to the wet slippery rocks.&nbsp; The rest of the 
    way up will require some scrambling and pack handling with the rope.&nbsp; 
    Tomorrow the climb and Mauve Saddle.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">[A chilling incident occurred 
    this day, not recorded in our journal entries, but recalled later by both 
    Jim and I when we completed the trip, and were told that a plane had gone 
    down in the Canyon on the 19th. In the late afternoon that day we heard a 
    circling aircraft somewhere within the Canyon, not far from us.&nbsp; We 
    first heard the engine sound overhead, it faded, and then it came back 
    again, giving us the impression&nbsp; that he was circling.&nbsp; The engine 
    sound faded again and we didn't hear it any more.&nbsp; It was raining and 
    heavily overcast, and we both commented on the plane to each other, and what 
    a bad place it was for those poor souls to be.&nbsp; We didn't know it, but 
    the plane crashed, probably seconds after we last heard it, killing 4 
    people.&nbsp; </font> </p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Jim and I went to the Grand 
    Canyon Visitor Center after we returned to report that we were back all 
    right, and because we had heard about the plane crash on the 19th we told 
    them what we heard.&nbsp; I recall that the crash site was somewhere just 
    west of Powell Plateau, which means that it was near our camp that night.&nbsp; 
    I have not been able to confirm the exact spot that the plane went down, but 
    I did find a brief NTSB aircraft crash report online.&nbsp; It was a Cessna 
    182G, flying from Hamilton, MT to Mesa, AZ.&nbsp; The crash time is listed 
    as 1642.&nbsp; The probable cause(s) were listed as &quot;continued VFR flight 
    into adverse weather conditions&quot; and &quot;spatial disorientation&quot;.&nbsp; 
    Apparently, they got lost in the clouds below the rim.</font></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .5in"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The implications of this 
    event have haunted me a bit, ever since. There was death in the Canyon, so 
    close to us that day.&nbsp; The next day, we almost died.&nbsp; What if we 
    had seen the crash, or stumbled upon it?&nbsp; What would we have done?&nbsp; 
    What could we have done?&nbsp; How would it have changed the trip, and our 
    fates? Quien sabe.]]</font></p>
