<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">A Perspective, 25 Years Hence</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;Tom Swetnam, March 2005</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the late winters of 
1978 and 1980, my brother Jim and I traversed long sections of the Grand Canyon 
on foot.&nbsp; For us, these trips were more than just hikes.&nbsp; They were intentional 
exposures of our lives and our senses to powerful doses of beauty, pain, 
excitement, exhaustion, inspiration, fear, exaltation, misery, and ultimately, 
exultation.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These two 18-day 
journeys were the most difficult physical challenges I have endured, and the 
most intense wilderness experiences of my life.&nbsp; Over the past 25 years I have 
drawn upon these Canyon experiences -- for confidence that I can endure great 
hardship, and for a serenity that comes from knowledge that such awesome places 
exist on this planet, that I visited them with considerable effort and risk to 
my life, and that I survived to savor and share the memories!&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I refer to the hikes 
here as “traverses” because they were length-wise routes in down (1978) and up 
river (1980) directions within the Canyon.&nbsp; To travel by foot down or up river 
in the Canyon, while staying entirely below the rim, requires that one traverse 
across the many side canyons that feed into <i>the</i> main canyon of the 
Colorado River.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Canyon is, of 
course, an incredibly rugged terrain.&nbsp; In addition to the main gorge containing 
the Colorado, there are hundreds of branching side canyons, with side, side 
canyons, and side, side, side canyons (etc.).&nbsp; Many of the side canyons are 
deeper than any canyon east of the Mississippi.&nbsp; Indeed, some are deeper than 
most canyons in the western hemisphere.&nbsp; Hence, traveling lengthwise in the 
Canyon requires that a hiker (1) traverse laboriously along benches and talus 
slopes around the heads of each side, side, side, etc. canyon; (2) travel down 
the main side canyons to the river and then traverse along the river beaches or 
talus slopes above the river, &nbsp;then back up another side canyon to come around 
its head; or (3) traverse directly across the side canyons, in a perpendicular 
fashion, via “fault ravines”, which create passable routes through cliff 
barriers such as the Redwall Formation.&nbsp; Usually, in any given section of the 
Canyon, only one or two of these traversing strategies are possible, so we used 
a combination of all three.&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter what the 
strategy followed, off-trail hiking in the Canyon is among the most difficult 
and challenging to be found anywhere.&nbsp; First, there is the 
tremendous topography.&nbsp; There are cliffs and angle-of-repose slopes that 
are hundreds to 
thousands of feet high in almost all directions.&nbsp; It simply is impossible to go 
to most off-trail places in the canyon, unless you are prepared to climb or 
scramble up, down, around, over or across cliffs, boulders, talus slopes, and 
other stone barriers of all conceivable sizes and shapes.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, the Canyon 
can be an extremely challenging place to hike during the spring, summer and fall 
because of high heat and lack of water.&nbsp; In winter of course, heat is not a 
problem, and water (for drinking) is less of a concern.&nbsp; But the difficulties 
and misery of physically moving through such trackless country are magnified in 
multiple ways by winter cold, rain, snow, ice, and mud – especially when 
carrying everything you need for survival on your back.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As it turned out, the 
weather conditions and rugged terrain of our routes made our trips 
excruciatingly difficult in many places and times, and at a couple of points 
(midway, both times) these conditions pushed us to the brink, to the verge of 
breaking.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mention all of this 
because it leads to one of the chief reasons why we did the hikes, and why the 
memories of those days still have powerful holds on both Jim and I.&nbsp; Isn’t it 
true that the value of a thing that one strives for, in the end, is often 
proportional to the amount of effort required, risks taken, and difficulties 
endured to achieve it?&nbsp; The “thing” here, of course, was nothing material, but 
rather just the experience, the accomplishment of having traveled through those 
magnificent and remote places under our own power.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hardships we 
endured during these journeys were important because they drove home the aesthetic 
experiences.&nbsp; The difficulties and risks, the inherent dangers of the place, 
magnified the impacts of the awesome beauty of the Canyon. The combination of 
intense worry, fear, physical exertion, and profound amazement at what we were 
seeing, hearing and feeling – gave us an acute sense of our own mortality, while 
at the same time creating a feeling of exaltation. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no other place 
on the planet where I feel this mix of fear and wonder so strongly.&nbsp; These are 
primal feelings that well up from deep within when standing on the edge of the 
abyss, looking down.&nbsp; They are fear of and wonder about the forces beyond me, as 
well as my personal power over my own life.&nbsp; One accidental or intentional step 
forward, and this life is over.&nbsp; But  would anything come next?&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For me, the fear I 
experience at the edge of the abyss shocks me into a kind of hyper-alertness and 
excitement.&nbsp; I can hear myself warning myself “be aware, be <i>very</i> aware of 
where you are, and what you are seeing and doing… don’t lose yourself… but yes, go 
ahead, look over the edge…”.&nbsp; This heightened awareness focuses and stimulates 
the senses, and when you are in the Canyon, surrounded by its immensity and 
magnificence of space and rock, reality becomes a very sharp external edge that 
cuts through all the other internal conversations going on in your brain.&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="4">&nbsp;</font><u><font size="4">Perspective</font></u></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, 25 years later, 
re-reading the journals, looking at the photos, and re-tracing the routes on 
maps, I am struck by several things:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trips were 
remarkably symmetrical.&nbsp; One went down river, the other up.&nbsp; They both 
extended lengthwise across the western 2/3rds of Grand Canyon National Park. The 
first trip was below the South Rim and the second below the North Rim.&nbsp; 
Both trips had distinctive and similar beginnings, middles, and endings.&nbsp; 
The beginnings were fraught with worry, mishaps, and false starts.&nbsp; The 
middles were marked by the hardest challenges and closest calls as we approached 
and passed the crux points:&nbsp; rounding Great Thumb Mesa and reaching Mauve 
Saddle.&nbsp;&nbsp; The endings both had favorable changes in weather, and 
despite more difficulties to overcome, we had a sense of downhill travel, that 
we were safely on our way home. Finally, on both trips the deep bedrock patterns 
of the Canyon imposed upon us our routes and passages, particularly the 
dichotomies of branching side canyons and the 
cross-cutting of faults and monoclines.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The journals reveal our 
youthful exuberance, fears, self indulgence, and  mysticism.&nbsp; Jim was 27 during 
the 1978 trip and I was 22.&nbsp; Now, from this vantage point in my middle age, I am 
a little amused, and perhaps a little chagrined about some aspects (e.g., the 
talk of “omens”, “pahos”, and “dope”).&nbsp; Perhaps I am also a bit wistful 
that I have lost the physical strength, naiveté, and chutzpah to do such things 
now, or to think in these ways.&nbsp; Twenty-five years as a scientist have changed my perspective on reality, 
but I can still appreciate the wonder that generated our mysticism.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In retrospect, I also 
can not ignore the selfish aspects of these trips.&nbsp; I exposed myself and, 
indirectly, my young family to risks.&nbsp; Suzanne waited and worried for about 18 
days during both trips, with no word of my fate until the end.&nbsp; Tyson was 
conceived after the first trip, and he was about 14 months old when I took the 
second trip.&nbsp; Emmy was conceived in January just before the second trip, but we 
did not know she was coming until I returned.&nbsp; In this context and hindsight, I 
recognize the foolishness of the trips.&nbsp; On the other hand, I was a young man, 
and there was something in me that needed these adventures before I did other 
things.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We certainly felt that 
what we were doing was something very special and unique.&nbsp; In retrospect, it was 
very special, but mostly to us.&nbsp; Other people had done parts of these routes before, such 
as Colin Fletcher (“The Man Who walked Through Time”), and Harvey Butchart (the 
math professor from NAU who traveled thousands of off-trail miles in the 
Canyon).&nbsp; We could argue that we did the routes in less time, or longer 
segments at once, in worse weather, or with less support (Fletcher had air drops 
of food and supplies!).&nbsp; But, my perspective now is that all of that is 
irrelevant.&nbsp; What matters is what the trips mean to us -- Jim and I -- not what 
anyone else thinks about them.&nbsp; It's true though, we did want to brag about the trips when we 
finished them.&nbsp; Maybe I still do, and these web pages are how I’m bragging now!&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="4" face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, we did 
risk it all, and we did come close to the edge, and we did witness the most 
awesome natural scenery we have ever seen.&nbsp; These are things that not many 
living people have witnessed and experienced in this manner, and in this day.&nbsp; 
These memories and experiences about life, endurance, natural beauty, and 
wilderness have resonated in my memory and consciousness ever since.&nbsp; Whenever I 
hear or read a survival story, or an account of a great wilderness adventure, such as that 
of Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery, or Shackelton and the crew of the 
Endurance, I think I know what it was like, at least a little bit.&nbsp; I believe I 
would have made it too, I would have survived; I could have done it because I 
endured something on a smaller scale, but similar,  concentrated in two 18-day traverses in the 
Grand Canyon, with my brother.</font></p>
